In this section, we'll go through detailed configuration for deploying demo application. 

## Create a deployment

To start, we'll first need to create a *deployment*. Deployment is a configuration used to create installer and update package for the application. To create new deployment, select *File -> New deployment* menu entry.

This will open the popup window where you can configure deployment. You only need to select project directory, which is the directory where you checked out application code in the first step of this quickstart tutorial. All other fields you can leave at default values, or customize them as needed.

When you create the deplyoment, it will appear in the sidebar tree.
